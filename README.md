# Game automation using AutoHotkey
*A guide to help you make games play by themself.*

# Welcome
AutoHotkey is scripting language to help you automate mundane tasks on your pc. It’s easy to learn but can be very powerful. This course will walk you through from basics like single key automation to advanced code writing to make it so that you don’t have to play all day just to level up once.

* **What you'll learn:** Use AutoHotkey to make games play by themselves.
* **How long:** You can read all of this in under 30 min, and I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed.

>_Although some games may allow passive activities like AFK (away-from-keyboard) grinding, this does not imply universal approval. The author does not condone or encourage the use of automation to gain unfair advantages in multiplayer or competitive settings; this content is intended to assist users in reducing the effort required for active grinding.

# Prerequisites
### **Must Have**
* **AutoHotkey [[Link]](https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/):** Its kind of obvious but you will need AutoHotkey for this, we will be using AutoHotkey v2 as there is no point in learning v1. Follow the Installation instructions its not very complicatied. 

* **VS code [[Link]](https://code.visualstudio.com/download):** Since we are writing a programme its recommended to use some kind of IDE, I personally use VS code with the following extensions.

    | Extensions    | Link   |
    | ----------    | ----   |
    | AHK++ (AutoHotkey Plus Plus)    | [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mark-wiemer.vscode-autohotkey-plus-plus)   |
    | AutoHotkey v2 Language Support    | [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thqby.vscode-autohotkey2-lsp)   |

### **Optional (but recomended)**

* **Roblox:** I know it’s kind of odd but it’s a convenient way for me to share a place where you can test out **your** code.
* **Prior Programming Knowledge:** If you know even a little about programming this course will be much easier for you to digest but if you don't, worry not as this course is very easy.

### Things to do
    bug:
    quick reference not working in Important Things to Know

    dont forget to add:
    while loop in Important Things to Know
    single instance in Important Things to Know

    game ideas:
    loop play a key
    movement in a same maze
    pixel detection click
    moving with coloured pixel
    optimised pixel detection
