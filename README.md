## Prerequisites
### **Must Have**
* **AutoHotkey:** Its kind of obvious but you will need AutoHotkey for this, we will be using AutoHotkey v2 which you can download [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/).
Follow the Installation instructions its not very complicatied. 

* **VS code:** Since we are writing a programme its recommended to use some kind of IDE, I personally use VS code with the following extensions.

| Extensions    | Link   |

### **Optional (but recomended)**

* **Roblox:** I know it’s kind of odd but it’s a convenient way for me to share a place where you can test out your code.
## Basics
